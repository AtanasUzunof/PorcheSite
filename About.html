                    The factory of the future is already a reality at Porsche in Leipzig and Zuffenhausen – as the new engine plant shows particularly clearly. Porsche has invested 80 million euros in the Zuffenhausen plant. Up to 200 engines per day can be installed here. Around 100 technical innovations are used in production alone. The foyer is more reminiscent of a technology centre. Bright as daylight, illuminated by modern LED lamps. The functions of the precision machines are checked by monitors. White floor, state-of-the-art technology: A futuristically oriented factory that sets standards and points the way to the future.

                    We are concerned with the development of one aspect above all else: the driver. That’s why, at the Porsche Track Experience it’s all about practice – right from the very first moment. The overriding principle: learning by doing – working through the various training levels and special onroad trainings. In this way, you can finely hone your driving skills, step by step. From the basics of vehicle control through to applying for your own racing licence. At one of the 19 locations currently available worldwide, all of which have one thing in common: the same high standards set by the Porsche Track Experience.
